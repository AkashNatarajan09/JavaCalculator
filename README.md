# ☕ Java Console Calculator

## Project Overview
A modular, menu-driven console calculator application developed in Java that performs core arithmetic operations with structured program flow and proper input validation. This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in Java programming, control structures, and clean coding practices.

## Tech Stack
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Command Line Interface (CLI)

## Key Features
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
- Menu-driven user interface using switch-case
- Continuous execution using loop control
- Input validation for robust user interaction
- Graceful handling of division-by-zero scenarios
- Clean and modular code structure

## Technical Implementation
- Applied OOP principles to organize logic
- Used switch-case for efficient operation handling
- Implemented loops for continuous execution
- Ensured exception-safe arithmetic operations
- Followed readable and maintainable coding standards

## How to Run

Compile:
javac Calculator.java

Run:
java Calculator

## Outcome
This project strengthened my understanding of Java fundamentals, control flow mechanisms, exception handling, and structured application design in a console-based environment.
